# Simulation exercises for Embedded Linux on FPGAs

This folder contains simulation exercises for the course.  It is a work-in-progress, but you should be able to either pull updates or check out a fresh copy when needed.

## Setup

First follow the [setup instructions](./docs/SETUP.md).  In particular:

- prepare a VM/system with appropriate Linux version
- install all the packages needed for compilation
- install the python environment and packages
- download and set up the Linux kernel, busybox, and renode
- set environment variables and PATH entries

## Exercises

Start by verifying that the python setup is working correctly, by running the example in `week00_basics`.  After that subsequent exercises each have their own README files with instructions on what to do.
